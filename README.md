A simple yet intresting code that can take a tic-tac-toe game to the next level, allowing machine learning to make things much more intresting.
the approach i used was creating a recursive minimax method that would go through every single possibility of the game that proceeds, and gives them a score of =1(X wins),
-1(0 wins), and 0(draw). Although depth is not required here as the the maximum possibilites arent that high,since tic tac toe is simple, i added it as a parameter either ways.
